# AwesomeProject
A project undertaken to learn and test a variety of React Native coding. 

I created this project for the purpose of me learning and testing a variety of React Native coding.  
As such it includes basics like layout, styleSheet, navigation and the likes. 
But it also includes an implementation of the Google Maps API,
as well as a Firebase database setup that allows adding of words to a list and the viewing of that list. 

//Installation
To install, download the main master project file and unzip it where you want it. 
Use a command prombt to navigate to the source level of the file (the one with the App.js file)
From there, run 

```
$ npm install
```

and wait for it to finish. 
After that it should be possible to run the project on the Android device of your choosing by way of, 

```
$React-Native Run-Android
```

The project was tested and run succesfully on a Samsung Galaxy Phone (Android 5.1.1, API 22)
And a Nexus 5X API Oreo 27 virtual device.
